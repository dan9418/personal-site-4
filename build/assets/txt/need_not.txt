1) Until Today

I outgrew - those values, I’m learning to - just shrug them off, they’re all store bought
   Empty words, to ignore  , always were - just secondhand, and i don’t understand

Suddenly, they’re speaking a language that I know
I’ve been here before, but it never felt like home, until today
There’s a voice in my head that makes sure I’m not alone
It spoke to me before, but didn’t sound like my own, until today

Taking my chances, nothing for granted

Turn the page - finally, come of age - whatever that means, wipe my hands clean
No dead weight - to let me, suffocate - in shit I don’t need, now I can breathe

I treasure every mem’ry even when they start to fade
This life was always mine, but it never had an aim, until today
I always had a name, but didn't need it anyway
I always had a voice, but didn’t know what to say, until today

Taking my chances, nothing for granted
Taking my chances, before they're taken for granted



2) Feel Something

Now this time with feeling, even if you’re feeling down
Just wanna make sure you still got both feet on the ground

So speak the truth, give me answers; heal my wounds, remiss my cancer
While the world was spinning around I was waiting for the sound of your voice

So feel something, argue with me
What would they say, if shadows could speak?

[Break]

Not as articulate as you could have been, I’m sure
But you never had to say those words before

So speak the truth, give me answers; heal my wounds, remiss my cancer
While the world was spinning around I was searching for the sound of your voice

So feel something, argue with me
What would they say, if shadows could speak?



3) Nature vs. Nature

Circumstance, assign each to a fate so unrequited, it’s not something that I decided
Not a chance, just a pointless game to strip my pride, boards and nails from the outside
The world I know is feeling feeble, it’s slow and silent, but it’s lethal
And if you’re lonely search for something, but I hope you know the cure isn’t more people

Nature vs nature vs me
I wonder who I will be
‘Til the river dries, I’ll bide my time
But nothing’s guaranteed

No statues left to search
(no statues left to search for meaning, laughing helps but it stops my breathing)
Their smiles are all just rehearsed
(they smile wide, but they’re deceiving,never found solace worth seeking)

Nature vs nature vs me
I wonder who I will be
Until the river dries, I’ll bide my time
But nothing’s guaranteed



4) Small World

The sun is taunting us, but we’ve been lost for awhile
It doesn’t know we’ve been dying to get lost - for awhile

The hills are all sinking, the hills have all sunk

And then the day shrugged so we just drove through the night

A key for every door
And a lot of advice that we ignored
Every mountain we climbed got a little bit taller
And suddenly the world got a whole lot smaller
There’s no room left for you here

We waited too long for someone else to decide
Sometimes it’s best to just draw a line on the map and drive

The world is now shrinking, the world has now shrunk
 
And then the night shrugged so we just drove another day

A treaty for every war
Overcome the advice that we ignored
(Like when they said:) “If you think you’re gonna be somebody
Get your ass back down on the ground now buddy
Cause I will tear you apart if you give me the chance”

So do it for you this time
Cause you do a lot of shit just to survive
Every mountain you climb will feel a little bit taller
But one day the world gets a whole lot smaller
So don’t spend it all right here

Cause that’s no way to live, no way to live
