1. Earthquake Day

A brush with death, chase the sun just to be the last to see it set
Roots so deep split the world in half trigger smoldering ash
A hairline fracture moving mountains awry
A molten dagger to repaint the valley and the sky 

Below the earth
It quietly waits
Or so says the myth

Cracks in the dirt
Entire landscapes
Cease to exist

The ground we walk, is just rock

Sea meets the sand
Lungs will with pine
Sight so divine

Everyone’s land
World built on pride
Watch it divide

Split on the seam
Right when it tears
Fall deep inside

Chasing the dream
The burden it bears
At least I tried

If mountains crumbled, fear would still guard its gates
A shapeshifter inside, quietly planning its escape
Like the craftsman who take a cardboard slate
And creates a puzzle with the tip of his blade

As long as my heart beats inside my chest
As sure as the sun sets in the west



2. Clarity
There’s no way of knowing, where it end and begins
I wish I’d known sooner, that’s what the thrill is

Some things we see everyday
Are reminders we’re still a long way from home

Follow nothing, no footsteps, they will lead you in the dark
No one else can take you, as new or as far

Some things we see everyday
Are reminders we’re still a long way from home

You can’t see until, can’t see until you’re blind
You don’t only see, only see with your eyes



3. Momentum

Summer peaked today, the sun’s already far away
Yesterday we were all still having fun
The memory remains, but life will never be the same
Though it feels like it’s only just begun

And then it’s over x3
How many are left?

Back on the lake, our masks all melted away
But it was never spoken
Long summer day, it was the last time I’d feel that way
And I didn't even notice

And then it’s over x3
Just like that



5. Reality Cruising

Organic, like plastic / Can’t you paint me something real
Build something, from nothing / Give me something I can feel

The truth and, some stitches / Tell me just one thing sincere
The sky screams, spouting lies / Masking everything I hear

Waste time in Eden, forget about Eve
See life with new eyes, never gonna leave

Waste time in Eden, forget about Eve
See life with new eyes, eyes can’t unsee
  
6. Amnesiac
They say we’re free to choose, but either way we lose
‘nother day in the box, cup of coffee and small talk
The breeze that whistled away our worries away silenced by mortar and concrete
Replaced by buzzing of monitors and it sounds a whole lot like defeat

Leave it all in the past, we are untied at last
We are born to forget, flawed and so imperfect
Leave it all in the past, we’re united at last
Our shackles melt in the sun, now we are free to run

Everything is new, just enjoy the view
Happy just to be breathing, smile for no reason
Abandoned toys in the corner, sooner than we’d like to admit
Pastimes gathering dust like an amnesiac’s note not to forget

Discover. Again. Be young. Again. Remember and forget, again and again
(Remember and forget, again and again and again)



7. The Optimist

Maybe, people, won’t fear
Everything that isn’t a mirror
Everyone who isn’t from here

Maybe, people, will care
We’re the same after all
A glass wall is still a wall

On the bright side looking out
On the dark side looking in

Maybe, cities, won’t sink
Not what to think, but to think
Look around you, don’t sleep a blink

Maybe, the clouds, will clear
Not every storm can wash us away
But everyone has something to say
8. America Incorporated
A dollar and a dream, or a corporate machine, wait your turn
Stuck in the routine, that’s the American Dream in reverse

It was their plan all along, make you believe hope is gone, watch it  burn
Forget what freedom means, that’s the American Dream in reverse

My country is strong, my country is bold
But today the song it sings is hollow and cold



9. Silent Spring

I used to, be able, to hear myself think
But now, it’s so loud, I can’t hear a thing

I used to be able to breath every day
But now, I’m lucky, to get fresh air on the weekends

Stop and listen, it's trying to speak
Like shadows in the dark, Like shadows in the dark

Just a penniless pool of indifferent parts
Like shadows in the dark

Pollute our air with poison and noise
Multiply like we don’t have a choice
Pollute our world with famine and flood
Pay no mind if it’s poor blood

We carved a valley, free but at what cost?
We all walk that fine line, we all walk that fine line

A survivor-less, not a victimless, crime
Drained until bled dry

Pollute our world with famine and flood
Pay no mind if it’s poor blood
Pollute our air with poison and noise
Multiply like we don’t have a choice (No choice, no choice to believe)

Our entire civilization is a clearing in the woods



10. Looper
That’s too sad a song to be singing all night long
That’s too sad a song to be singing at all
Fall together and fall apart
Remember to love the human part

We’re all just waiting, we’re all just waiting for all our pieces to fit
We’re all just waiting, we’re all just waiting for all our stories to drift
The future fades away
The future comes every day

When your friends move away, what's next
When they each take a piece of you, what's left? 
All of the people in my dearest, fondest memories
Aren’t around anymore to remember with me

Over and over and over again.
