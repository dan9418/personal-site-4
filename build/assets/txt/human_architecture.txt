All songs are instrumental.

However, lyrics were originally written for most songs and are included below:


1) History Begins [Temperance]

And so it begins, the search for truth
Questions harbored in the young mind and forgotten after youth
A grain of sand, falls from your hands
Life set in motion by the will of your command

For the first time, open your eyes
History never dies

Ashes of millennia, lost in the wind
Scattered over all the places you've been
Time ticks away, day after day
Pieces of forever lie untouched and dissolve
A puzzle time never solves


2) Collector [Lust]

<Instrumental>


3) Constellations [Patience]

Expansive far beyond physical means
But capped on one end by its reflection on the sea
The sky speaks to me, though voiceless and dark
And I see your name written out in the stars


4) New Idol [Averice]

So you've come this far, do you feel proud?
Everybody now, has got you figured out
Your time has come, you lonely scum
To count your sins, and erase them from, your grin
Is that all you have to give?

You lived beyond your means like no one's ever seen
You always wanted mas, but it was never enough

You acquired for yourself, and then what was left?
Everybody else nearly starved to death
You drank the ocean dry
And left the rest of us to die


5) Tremors [Envy]

Otherwordly and infectous, a voice like none I have heard
And when she sings, I hang on every word

A heavenly tune to whom I'm in debt
Send the hairs dancing up the back of my neck

Now I see her lips move with skillful intent
But in spite of the sound the room remains silent

A thousand people listen to her sing
Oh, what I'd give to hear such a beautiful thing

But it's been years...

I can't hear a word she says, but she still sends tremors down my spine
The way she sings is so divine


6) In Valor & Venom [Wrath]

Recall the first taste of venom, when the bullet grazed the skin
Don't believe a word they say, they want you to give in
Freedom cost a thousand lives, now this is how we pay
You built yourself an empire and wished it all away


7) Gyroscope [Kindness]

Your invitation, the words are so rare
A small reminder that you're there
I will follow you where I once was scared
To stand alone in the cold open air

Revolutions count the seconds we're apart
Spinning gracefully inside of my heart

Somewhere to turn to when the path becomes unclear
Give me direction, show me where to go from here
Your words soothe me like music to my ears
To reassure me there's nothing left to fear


8) Eyes Averted [Diligence]

Maybe not today, but I swear I'll get my chance
I'll find someone who listens and tell them all of my plans
Well, so long
I'd travel a thousand miles just to find out that I don't belong

What does it mean? To see your reflection in their eyes but not be seen?

The last of my doubts have exacted their revenge
And I'm afraid it's too late for me to make amends

In my weakest moment, when hope was long gone
Lies were enough to prove that I was wrong
Caught in between the lines
Mend my broken pieces and realign my hazy eyes

How obscene, all alone in a crowded street

The last of my doubts have exacted their revenge
And I'm afraid it's too late for me to make amends


9) Fiend [Gluttony]

<Instrumental>


10) Atrophy [Sloth]

I'm feeling sick today
My bones are wearing thin
I can feel myself today
From underneath my skin

Waste away, to shut out all the pain

It seems apathy has won
Nature played a nasty trick
What have I done?
With God's greatest gift?

Atrophy, I never thought I'd be me


11) Waking Hours [Chastity]

A mystery, she is to me, from the depths of dreams she's risen
To fill my waking hours with melotonic (laced) grace
Transcend what can be seen and share with me your fragility
And I will harbor all your secrets until my dying day

Wordless, breathless, faultless prose
Spoken in languages nobody knows

A quiet kind of thought, no sign of company
Alone in a reassurance that doubts cannot sway
But share with another, equally alone
Listening closely to what only eyes can say

Timeless, endless, perfect moments
Time goes by, but goes unnoticed


12) Seek Shelter [Charity]

Here, she holds him near and wipes a tear away
Spoken softly though her voice will know how to put the fears at bay
Cradled in her arms to keep him from the cold
It warms her heart just to know that he's there to hold

All debts relieved, he relents to sleep
She lets him go, now he's on his own

Some seek shelter as the sun shrinks away
Some find sunlight at the end of the day

The steady hum of monitors suffocates the room
His reassurance comforts her, no matter how untrue
We all have day we find we're only human
Their hands are locked together when one grip finally loosens

A silent exchange, break free from the chains
Or so it goes, no one really knows

Time makes amends, it begins again


13) Architecture [Pride]

Quite a clever ruse
The way it looks and thinks and acts like me
The way it takes my name and shares my thoughts
The way it sings my praise and worships the same god

And yet I watch from afar
Afraid to step in its direction
To sit under the same sky
To look it in the eye

It's you that I adore, the one that I long for
Can you see I am disease and I am the cure?


14) Last Will [Humility]
