“In Loving Memory”
Dedicated to Herbert Vargo III

This doesn’t feel real, I still can’t believe that you’re gone.
The memories that you left me are worth more than just a song
The things that we did, the things that we saw,
And the things that I’ll never get to say after all.
Now all the time, it feels like something is wrong,
Where your feet once stood, our tears now fall.
Your presence is missed; your memories stand tall,
But I’m just not ready to say my final so-long.
No doubt that life is a gift to us from above,
And fifteen years of it is not nearly enough,
Losing you has taught me what tears are made of:
The long nights of wishing to see someone that you love.
You were like a brother to me, growing up by my side.
We’d always wonder how to spend the rest of our lives.
But it’s too late now, I wish I could go back in time.
Push rewind; and find my self in fifth grade just fine.
Before all this misery ever came into our life.
Before all this strife, when everything was all right.
Before we even had a reason to cry.
Before I had to see one of my closest friends die.

I have so much to tell you, I pray that you can hear.
With every word that is for you, comes the drying of a tear.
I’m always thinking of you, but you have nothing left to fear.
Please watch over us from where you sit in Heaven’s great frontier.
Every time I see your face, I recall the times I can’t replace,
I always try to hide the pain; I know you’re in a better place,
But it feels like you should be here with us, ready for another day.
Wake up to get on the bus, then watch it slowly drive away.
But it’s not the end; It’s a new life for you.
And I know you’ll be waiting for me when my time comes too.
Until then, I’ll never forget the things that we went through.
And as long as I can breath, my prayers are for you.
In loving memory, we kneel and pray on our knees.
In loving memory, we watch the tears spread like a disease.
In loving memory, we beg and ask God please:
Help us through this tragedy, we’re desperately in need.
And in loving memory, we try; we do our best to believe
 That where you are now is actually where you oughta be. 
Rain, snow, wind, hail, ice, or sleet, 
I’ll be praying for you buddy, I won’t admit defeat. 
The tears fall hard, the scars run deep.
This world doesn’t deserve you, you left it incomplete.
It kills me to see what it’s done to all of my friends
And everyone else who loved you to no end. 
We’ll never forget all of the words that you said,
And we’ll learn what we can from the life that you led.
The loss of a brother is hard to comprehend.
But your memory will live on; your soul is now content.




Paperwork

I had a boring office job, where I would file papers.
I would put them all in order, then alphabetize the layers.
I would wake up everyday, to the same mundane alarm.
And I would eat the same old breakfast, of burnt toast and Lucky Charms.
I’d leave my house at nine a.m. and return again at five.
Get stuck in traffic, autobiographic, story of my life.
I woke up the next morning with my head upon the carpet.
My landlord told me that some thieves had been to my apartment.
They took everything, including my TV.
My dignity, my self respect; they took everything from me.
The only thing they left behind was lying in the corner.
My bankruptcy and unpaid bills for expired theft insurance.

So one day, I told myself that I’m giving up.
I’m getting nowhere, going no place, and running out of luck.
That was when I decided I was meant for more
Than filing papers, paying bills, and sleeping on the floor!

The next Monday morning, I woke up around noon.
I raised my hands above my head and looked around the room.
Still empty as my bank account, so I left it for the last time.
That day would be the one that changed my entire life.
When I arrived, I sat around and did nothing but complain.
So my boss came to talk to me and ask why I was late.
I said “I’m sick of this boring job.” Yeah, that’s right; that’s what I told him.
Then I grabbed my stapler and chased him round till I finally got a hold of him. 
But I guess the ruckus made someone scared, cause then the cops showed up.
They had got my hostage, but I had got away, and I finally had enough.
I got up on my desk and gave them the announcement:
“I don’t work here anymore, you can have my endowment.”
“I’m sick of all your lies, and if there’s one thing that I’ve learned, it’s that
I can’t stand your institution and I won’t do no more paperwork!”

By that time, they were all staring, so I got down and ran off.
No one gave chase; no one looked back, so I found myself a box.

Now that’s where I live, I have all I need to stay away from harm:
A place to sleep, some bugs to eat, and four cardboard walls to keep me warm.




The Ballad of Billy Mays

Billy Mays, Billy Mays
Where are you now?
I need some Oxyclean
And you are nowhere to be found

Billy Mays, Billy Mays
Always yelling at me
You were the coolest advertising salesman 
I ever saw on TV

BILLY MAYS! BILLY MAYS!

Billy Mays, Billy Mays
Where are you now?
I need some Mighty Putty
But you are nowhere to be found

Billy Mays, Billy Mays
Always screaming at me
You were the loudest advertising salesman 
That I ever saw on TV

BILLY MAYS! BILLY MAYS!
Kaboom!

Awesome Auger, Ding King, Dual Saw, EZ Crunch Bowl
Mighty Putty, Orange Glo, Oxyclean, Zorbeez!

BILLY MAYS! BILLY MAYS!
Sham Wow! 
Oh wait, that was the other guy…

We miss you…
