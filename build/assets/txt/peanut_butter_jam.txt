Compose yourself, and get pulled apart again
No one needs to know, the trouble were

I wanna wake up someplace I've never been
I was born to be born again
I wanna wake up someplace I've never seen
I was born to a refugee

The teeth and the gears, grind to a halt
Keep telling yourself, it's not your fault

I wanna wake up someplace I've never been
I was born to be born again
I wanna wake up someplace I've never seen
I was born to a refugee
