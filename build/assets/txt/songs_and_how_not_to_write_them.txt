1) REVOLUTION: DAY ONE

I turned on the radio and listened to a song
To my dismay, the DJ was all wrong
He said it was a hit, but I really must admit
It was just another song that sounded like shit
All this music sounds the same, just static on the airwaves
These puppet pop stars think that music is a game
And now it seems we're all part of the charade
The whole population is a victim of the plague

Take it, and throw it away
Till there's nothing left to say
It all sounds the same
The revolution starts today

Hey man, hey man!
Go start a band!
Write some kick-ass songs and 
stick it to the man!

Take it, and throw it away
Till there's nothing left to say
It all sounds the same
The revolution starts today

2) BOB
Lyrics by Fat Mike

3) REVENGE OF THE PINK FLAMINGO

Suzie was a pink flamingo, who sat in the yard
Day and night she stood alone, always standing guard
Until the day her owner put a lawn gnome by her side
Jealously then overcame the lawn ornaments that night
Because suddenly the gnome and the bird came alive
There was only room for one, so the other must die
The battle of the century had finally begun
The two foes will fight till there stands only one, yeah!

Suzie the pink flamingo

Underneath the stars, the battle raged on
Each contender fighting till the crack of dawn
The gnome was kicking Suzie's pink plastic ass
Till blood and feathers were strewn across the grass
But Suzie then returned with a great flamingo blast
That sent the gnome flying away in a flash
But then the sun rose and they froze in mid-fight
Paralyzed by the day's natural sunlight
But that's not the end for our tiny little friends
For tomorrow night, they'll do it all again

Suzie the pink flamingo(x4)

4) I MELT WITH YOU
Lyrics by Modern English

5) NO DIRECTION

The time of the elephants has gone and past
Come on baby, not lets make this last
Let’s blow this sucker-free popsicle stand
Don’t you know who I think I am?
This is the last time I milk a cow
I love how all the flowers dance around
Sell you stocks, take my hand
The convoluted revolution’s sinking in sand

RAISE YOUR GLASS
KICK SOME ASS

We’re taking off now, so hold on tight  
Newspaper articles are black and white
Where do you go when they liquidate your home?
Hold the phone, show me where buffalo roam
I‘d look for an answer but I’ve only two eyes
And I’m gonna see with both eyes tonight.
One giant step for some kind of man
But he better be careful where he puts his hands

RAISE YOUR GLASS
KICK SOME ASS

6) Sell Out
Lyrics by Aaron Barrett, Scott Klopfenstein

Lyrics(?) by Kurt Cobain

8) JUST ANOTHER

Right now, you're out there waiting
For me to come and save you too
But you will never see the light
The light that you have led me to (yeah, yeah)

Why do you say I'm not like the others
Why the hell would I be just another
Should you care if I don't last forever
Did you hear me, or did I stutter
Don't just stand there and watch me suffer
You won't find another lover like me (like me)

Now I'm just sitting, just contemplating
Whether you're there to save me too
For now, the clouds are floating by
They hide the light from shining through (yeah, yeah)

9) WALKING THE PLANK

I be a pirate and this be me ship
I have but one eye and a sword round me hip
And where I once had a functional leg
Now stands me beloved hard wooden peg
All cross the land me name is feared
Lubbers cringe at the sight of me beard
Upon me should sits me favorite parrot
<Awk, me favorite parrot>
Now allow me to introduce you
To the rest of me swashbuckling, sea-faring crew

Aye Aye Cap’n, ‘tis a fine day indeed
A pirate’s life be the life for me
Searching for booty and drinking up rum
These be the things pirates do for fun
There’s not a ship in these waters that we haven’t sank
Cause all who oppose, go walking the plank!
<Pirate Sounds>

15) REQUIEM FOR THIRD WAVE SKA

I once heard that a long, long time ago
There was a brass section at punk rock shows
Complemented by guitars playing upstrokes
At ridiculously fast tempos

Whatever happened to that awesome music scene
That took place from the mid to late nineties?
Sometimes I sit back and wonder why...

Some call it freedom, some call it love
We personally call it third wave ska (third wave ska)
This one's for our favourite extinct genre 

The first time the world had heard of the ska
Was in its native country of JAMAICA
Then the English made it their own
They revised the sound and called it two-tone

But in the 1990s
Ska rose again
A third wave of ska
Began to begin (lol grammar)

Reel Big Fish, we'd like to say thanks
For keeping alive the tradition of the skank
Less Than Jake, you guys rule
When we met you on tour, you were super cool
NOFX, what can we way?
We really like your songs and you're REALLY FUCKING GREAT
Mighty Mighty Bosstones, you know what's up
Because one "mighty" just wasn't enough

Sublime, Suicide Machines
Rancid, Operation Ivy
Goldfinger, Mustard Plug
Big D, and Jeffery's Fan Club
Aquabats, Voodoo Glow Skulls
Authority Zero and that's not all
I guess we should include, No Doubt
And the first album by, Smash Mouth

So many bands to whom we owe our thanks
Well guys, this one's for you

The first three waves were great, but we're ready for number four!
