1) White Christmas
Lyrics by Irving Berlin


2) The Year That Flying Monkeys Saved Christmas

Everyone knows magic reindeer can fly
Christmas spirit lets them soar through the sky
But spirit's only high during the winter months
The rest of the year, they're on the ground, stuck

So Santa made a deal with the local zoo
He fed the monkeys pixie dust so that they could fly too
And now they steer his sleigh when Christmas cheer is low
And that's how the big guy gets around when there's no snow

But one year, when Christmas came, the reindeer felt sick
They were far too weak to make the special annual trip
But Santa remembered the monkeys and their flying skills
And that's how the children got their presents when the reindeer felt ill

And that was the year that flying monkeys saved Christmas


3) Randolph The Red-Headed Gingerbread Man

Ho Ho Ho!

Randolph was a red-head made of gingerbread
With gumdrop button and red icing on his head
All the other cookies made fun of his red hair
And the pasty white dough that made his skin fair

In was in these passing moments that Randolph realized 
he was nothing more than a crumb blowing in the wind

Then when Christmas came and Santa was putting presents under the tree
The jolly bearded man was hungry for a treat
Randolph's red hair was the brightest in the batch
So Santa choose him to throw down the hatch

Randolph was a hero in the world of baked goods
They all realized he was just misunderstood
Santa's milk and cookies were the stuff of legends
And Randolph got to join them up in the heavens


4) The Elf Who Wanted To Be A Dentist

Hermie was an elf who worked in Santa's shop
The pay was great but he really hated his job (hated his job)

So he enrolled into the arctic school of dental hygiene
Now he makes his living taking care of teeth

Hermie was the elf who wanted to be a dentist instead
